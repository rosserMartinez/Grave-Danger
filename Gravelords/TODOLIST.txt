SHADER HIGHLIGHTING FOR GRAVES?

flowers???
come back to it once you fix movement for undead


TODAY:
undead qol, convert movement to strictly rigidbody

QOL
undead are too strong
knockback is too hard / stacks with multiple
they move too fast, no digging can occur
you cant hit them off of you effectively
undead shouldnt be able to stack, need to move objects
position via RIGIDBODY as opposed to using the built in stuff (see code comments for more details)

you cant knock players back hard enough
hard to control where other player is going
it is hard to move within range of the other player to hit them

graves are too easy to fall into
you should not be able to walk over graves while they are not dug
cant dig and fall into it

no flowers yet this game SUCKS

dash OVER GRAVES???? naaaaniiiiii
